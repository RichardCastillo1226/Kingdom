            </br>
            <p> There are many health benefits of owning a pet. They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Keeping your pet at a healthy weight lowers the risk of diabetes and respiratory disease. In fact, excess weight can reduce your pet's life span by more than two years. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship. We care about pets and their wellbeing. These pets are unaware of what they consume and don't know what is best for them. That is why it is up to us as humans to give them better foods. The right kinds of food, which will help them live a long healthy life. At the end of the day, our mission is to protect them due to the fact that they can't nurture themselves. </p>
